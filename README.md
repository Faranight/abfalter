Anima Beyond Fantasy Alter System for Foundry VTT, Thank you Anima Project Studio for allowing me to do this.

As a single developer, I have built certain character sheet mechanics that would suit my own group more. However, most of the core mechanics remain unchanged.
I plan to incorporate plenty of qol mechanisms into the character pages and the system itself. Thank you Linkaynn and the other members who are developing the other Anima Beyond Fanatasy page for allowing me to use your idea for the combat calculator.

There is full localization implemented, however, as of now only the EN is completed.

# Planned Updates
- Combat calculator is still in development.
- Certain items don't have a 'send to chat' function yet.
- clean up of the settings tab.
- Automatic mastery detection.
- Active effects.
